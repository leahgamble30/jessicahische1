<h2 id="About:">About:</h2>

<p>Jessica Hishe is an incredible lettering artist who works a lot with decorative typefaces for her own business freelancing her work. Jessica was born in 1984, Jessica is from America, more specifically South Carolina. Jessica has an incredible talent for illustration and decorative artwork focusing on lettering, which has been used in a range of areas. Jessica always had a love for design and drawing, as mentioned in many interviews. Jessica went to The Tyler School of Art for interactive and graphic design. It was interesting to learn about Jessicas background and how she found her niche in the industry.</p>

<hr>

<p>After working for Louise Fill, while creating her own freelancing business on the side. This side of her story was particularly interesting because of Jessica’s entrepreneurial skills and her love for the “side” projects she was working on, she created a very successful business doing what she loves. Jessica now lives in Oakland, California with her husband and 3 children, continuously working on projects for organisations and continuing to expand her business.</p>


<h2 id="style:">Her Style</h2>

<p>As I was doing research into Jessica Hische, I of course came across some of her beautifully designed artwork. She has a very decretive style of artwork, taking the existing structure of letter forms within certain typefaces and turning them into an artwork. She works with many different mediums of art, such as watercolour, digital art and even coffee. While researching Jessica I found her creativity to be inspiring she did not just stick to the basic art forms but anything that was at hand she tried to make an art piece out of it. Her decorative lettering art also shows her ability to illustrate different aspects of her letters. Whether that is taking a regular times new roman “K” and turning that into a three-dimensional “K” Jessica does this in the most creative way, ensuring her artwork is appropriate for her clients.</p>

<div class="light">

  

   </div>

   <hr> 

<p>Jessica not only uses her lettering art to create advertisements or decorations for companies she also uses her artwork very creatively to create logos, weather it is just a simple logo refresh for a company, where the difference is subtile yet makes a big difference to how a brand may appear or a lettering logo done from scratch, her knowledge of type makes the logos really professional for the companies she is working with.</p>





<p>While watching many interviews of Jessica Hische I was able to see clearly what her process to creating her artwork was. Firstly, Jessica finds inspiration, whether it is a quote or a case study, she has to start by finding content to create. Then she experiments with potential layouts for her design, allowing her ideas to get down on paper. Once Jessica has decided on a layout, she will start by making a more detailed sketch of the lettering art. Then the next part of her process is making it digital or starting to finalise her piece, whether it is starting to paint or creating her work on procreate. Then lastly depending on her project, she will vectorise the image so it does not come out pixelated for her client or print.</p>




<h2 id="business:">Her Business:</h2>

<p>Jessica’s business growth was an extremely interesting topic to research and I want to make it a large focus of my essay because it is fascinating to see how far Jessica has come, from her time at college to now, with a fruitful and profit making business, working with some of the worlds biggest companies, creating unique letter forms to fit each brand she may work with.</p>



        <div class='row'>
          <div class='column'>
            
                <p>Jessica Hishe has grown a very successful company for her lettering business. In several interviews Jessica talks about loving the freedom that a business gave her. Starting her business in 2009, Jessica started a daily drop of illustrated letters, which started gaining popularity across the internet, which started her very successful career of getting invited to speak at conferences, which in turn got her more clientele. Jessica has worked with many exciting businesses through her time as a freelance lettering artist. Jessica has worked for companies such as Tiffany&Co, New York Times and Starbucks.</p>

</div>


<p>Her work is continuously done to an incredible standard, with each lettering piece being extremely influential and individual within the lettering art community.Jessica has not only scaled her business incredibly as we can see in terms or her clients she is very well known for what she creates </p>


</div>
<base targets=_blank>
    
<h2 id="educating:"> Educating:</h2>

    <p>Jessica also teaches on platforms such as youtube and skill share, to try and help individuals who want to become better lettering artists. Through further interview research of Jessica Hische I discovered her passion for skillshare and why she has decided to teach her lettering skills on skillshare, because it allows her to impact people around the world who may not necessarily have the means to pay for an education, her passion for teaching those all over the world is truly inspiring.</p>

    


<h2 id="online-shop">Online Shop:</h2>

<p>Alongside her clients Jessica Hishe has her own shop, where she sells he prints, which can be used for decoration. Another side to Jessica’s art shop is her fonts which designers or artists can buy to use in their own artwork, this is a smart business idea because it allows Jessica to make an income for simply creating a font, this is a great side income alongside her other clients.</p>

    </div> <p>It is great to see how Jessica Hische has grown her business over the space of 12 years, she has expanded her routes of income to make a living off of her inspirational art. Overall, Jessica is a great inspiration, not just for creating typefaces or logotypes, but for educating people on the market of lettering art/graphic design she is a great representation for “Thinking outside the box” and showing different typefaces in a wonderful way.</p>




<h2 id="lettering-comparison:">Lettering Comparison:</h2>

<p>As I mentioned previously Jessica has a very decorative style to her font choices, with other fonts she created being very clean and universal in order to sell them. Jessica has created many fonts, to generate further income, where artists can pay to download her fonts and create their own artwork using them. </p>

    

<p>Firstly I will be talking about how the fonts she has created compare to everyday fonts we use today, primarily thinking of fonts such as Times New Roman, Baskerville, Futura and Helvetica, these fonts are commonly used and I want to show how Jessica has used these fonts to form the basis of her lettering art. Jessica has created a variety of fonts such as Buttermilk, Brioche and Minot which is extremely decorative. Jessica has had inspiration from many sources, weather it is movies or similar typefaces, some of her fonts clearly represent a different side of typefaces used everyday. The main style of typeface that I can see Jessica creates is usually taken inspiration from a scripted, serif style of typeface, which are beautiful when used for branding or invites, etc.</p>

<hr>

<p>Buttermilk and Tilda, are more of a script style of font but are extremely beautiful, both seem to have taken inspiration from typefaces such as Baskerville and Times New Roman.
Where as some of the sans fonts she has designed such as  compare very nicely to Helvetica or Futura. </p>



<p>Throughout researching Jessicas own fonts I was able to see how she gained inspiration from already formed letters, she was just building on the knowledge she already had and what was in front of her. The fonts she has created have been used for many purposes, and despite being decorative fonts they can be extremely versatile.</p>


<p>Moving on to her more decorative pieces that Jessica creates using illustrations, that pair well for book covers or branding especially. Her beautiful artwork has the basic structure of a letter but as you can see Jessica has went a step further and built upon the letter, it is almost like the font which is already there are the bones of an art piece for Jessica and the illustrations/letter art is the flesh to bring interest and shape differences for her pieces of artwork.</p>


<div class="light">
    <section>
<h2 id="conclusion:">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that Jessica Hische has created some wonderful and compelling designs throughout her career. I believe in comparison to other typefaces, her artwork is definitely tailored to her client, she does not try to create a whole new letter style but rather builds on the foundations of typefaces such as, Futura, Baskerville and Gill sans, you can see in her artwork how she has built upon timeless typefaces, to allow her creativity to flow but still have a structure to create an elegant and branding worthy letter style for each of her clients.</p>
